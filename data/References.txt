The Movies Dataset - Metadata on over 45,000 movies. 26 million ratings from over 270,000 users: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

The following files from the dataset were used:
credits.csv
keywords.csv
links_small.csv
movies_metadata.csv
ratings_small.csv

This was chosen over the 5000 TMDB dataset as we wanted more than just 5k data (we used about 9k+ from The Movies Dataset), we also needed user data for collaborative filtering & hybrid algorithm.
